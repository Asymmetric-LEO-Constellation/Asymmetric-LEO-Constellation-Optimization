# Asymmetric-LEO-Constellation-Optimization-A-Population-Based-Approach

This is the repo for the paper "Asymmetric LEO Constellation Optimization: A Population-Based Approach". In this repo, you will find images of the two types of uniform Walker Delta Constellations as well as gifs for the Random Operator 216 satellite constellation and the two uniform distributions for the 216 constellation size.


'Plane 1 Positions' illustrates every location a simulated satellite on plane 1 can occupy.

'Starlink Ground Statin and Populations" illustrates the ground station locations (black) and the populations able to be covered (red) in our simulations.

Uniform Distributions illustrates two example uniform distributions. The left is a 90 minute distribution, and the right is a 1,530 minute distribution.
