In this folder, you can find GIFs of the satellites in orbit. The "216RandomOperators" gif is an asymmetric constellation our algorithm designed, the "216sats180distribution" and "216sats1530distribution" gifs are Walker Delta constellations. Only the first 180 time slices (90 minutes) are visible in the gifs. Note that coverage is still imperfect with the optimized constellation due to the low number of satellites used.
