In this folder, you can find GIFs of the satellites in orbit. The "216RandomOperators" gif is an asymmetric constellation our algorithm designed, the "216sats180distribution" and "216sats1530distribution" gifs are Walker Delta constellations. 

Only the first 180 time slices (90 minutes) are visible in the gifs.  Note that coverage is still imperfect with the optimized constellation due to the low number of satellites used. 

As per the paper, our constellation has a fitness value 35.76% higher than the 180 distribution and 50.87% higher than the 1530 minute distribution.
